When working with a lot of feature files in <a href="http://www.cukes.info">cucumber</a> you'll sooner or later run in to the problem of having 2 similar statements ie:
<pre class="brush: ruby">Then /^epic .*$/ do
end

Then /^epic fail$/ do
end</pre>
If you just run cucumber &lt;feature file&gt; with this definition it will fail with the following error: <strong>Ambiguous match of "epic fail"</strong>. To solve this problem just add --guess on the command line (cucumber --guess &lt;feature file&gt;). What <a href="http://rubyforge.org/pipermail/rspec-devel/2009-January/005196.html">happens</a> is that the cucumber runner does a bit of evaluating to decide what method to call, so far it has worked as expected.

Files needed to test:
* fail.feature:
<pre class="brush: plain">Feature: Fail
	In order to test this
	I want a feature file that contains a test

	Scenario:
	Given a dummy
	When a win
	Then epic win

	Scenario:
	Given a dummy
	When an epic fail
	Then epic fail</pre>
* fail_step.rb
<pre class="brush: ruby">Given /^a dummy$/ do
end

When /^a win$/ do
end

When /^an epic fail$/ do
end

Then /^epic .*$/ do
end

Then /^epic fail$/ do
end</pre>
