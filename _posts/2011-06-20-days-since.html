So I hacked together a small api, <a href="http://dayssince.heroku.com">Days Since</a>, what it does is returns the days passed since an inputted date. It's a small Rails site listening to one route (year/month/day) and then calculates the offset compared to the current date. For fastest way of hosting I put it on my <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a> account, the free version is more than enough for the small load it will generate.

The index page looks rather boring since I lack all forms of UI skills :)
