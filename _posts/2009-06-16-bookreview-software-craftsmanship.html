I'm in a small book club and the last book we've read wasÂ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Software-Craftsmanship-Imperative-Pete-McBreen/dp/0201733862/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1244784792&amp;sr=8-1">Software Craftsmanship: The new imperative</a> by Pete McBreen. The main argument of the book is that the Software Engineering concept was designed to handle huge defence projects and is not suitable for most projects since they are a lot smaller.

So the solution for this according to Pete should be a system where we have Apprentices, Journeymen and Craftsmen that make up the team. In many ways it would be to revert to the medieval ways of craftsmen where you would work for a craftsman to learn how it's done. There's also on many occasions the argument that it's better to hire few great developers than a lot of decent, it's the first time I've seen it in print but something one often talk about.

While i don't think it's mentioned in the book to me it seems at many times that Pete is talking about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_Programming">XP</a> along with some of the concepts from <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer">Pragmatic Programmer</a>. The concept of the book appeals to me but at the same time I think it might be hard to apply in a consultant/contractor organisation as it requires a stable team, however for a product/project development/delivery team it could be a good way to increase quality.

*Closing: might not be the best bookreview but mabey the next one's better :)
