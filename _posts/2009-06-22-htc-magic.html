Picked up an <a href="http://www.htc.com/europe/product/magic/overview.html">HTC Magic</a> yesterday, only used it for a day but I've already decided that it's the best phone I've ever used. The Android OS is fast and looks better in reality than in the images I've seen.

Right now I'm filling it with cool apps and mostly playing around but next thing to do is to install Eclipse and the Android SDK so I can start developing apps.
