<a href="http://dump.tacticalnuclearstrike.com/device.png"><img class="alignright" title="androids" src="http://dump.tacticalnuclearstrike.com/device.png" alt="" width="153" height="256" /></a>A couple of days ago I uploaded the first version of ttTumblr on Android Market. It's a small app that allows the user to create content on a <a href="http://tumblr.com">tumblr </a>blog. At the moment, release 3, supports posting images from both gallery and by taking an image with the camera, creating text, quote, link and chat posts. I'm working on video upload but it's disabled for now until I figure out why the uploaded videos break during transcoding.

Features planned include (in no particular order)
<ul>
	<li>Working video uploading</li>
	<li>View the users dashboard (both on entries and those from people you follow)</li>
	<li>Support for other character sets (Russian, Chinese etc)</li>
	<li>Posting audio, unsure if there's any real use/need for this</li>
</ul>
It's an open source project under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT license</a> so the source can be found here: <a href="http://github.com/FredrikL/android-ttTumblr">github</a>
