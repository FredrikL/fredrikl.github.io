A short one. Just so I don't forget, then again Subversion never forgets! Don't use SchemaExport on existing dbs, it breaks them!
<pre class="brush: csharp;">if(!File.Exists("episkfail.db"))
    new SchemaExport(cfg).Execute(false, true, false, false);</pre>
and yes, it's a part of my twitter client that I code a bit on when I got nothing better to do =)
