So, just uploaded my first Android application to Android Market. It's called Flashlight, at this stage very very simple. The only thing it does is to set the brightness to 100% and shows a fullscreen white background. So yes I agree that it's quite boring but i have some ideas of features to add, and I'm open for suggestions.

Since opensource is fun I'll add upload it to <a href="https://github.com/">github</a> as soon as i get the hang of git.

Not sure how long it takes for <a href="http://www.androlib.com/">AndroLib</a> to index the app but it can be found on the Market just search for 'Flashlight' and look for my name. Another way of finding it would be to search on the package name: com.tacticalnuclearstrike.flashlight.
