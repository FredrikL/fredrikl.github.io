(Just a small post mostly for myself, in case i forget)

I've been playing a bit with ruby the last couple of days, mostly because i migth get to use it at work later on and a saw i short demo by <a href="http://thomaslundstrom.blogspot.com/">Thomas Lundström</a> on cucumber at the latest <a href="http://oresund.altdotnet.org/">Alt.Net Öresund</a> meeting. However his demo was on IronRuby testing .Net code and it was too slow to be useful . So here's a short summary of how to implement the example on the cucmber<a href="http://cukes.info/"> homepage</a>.

First the feature, just a plain text file defining the scenario we want to test:
<pre class="brush: plain;">Feature: Addition
  In order to aviod silly misstakes
  As a math idiot
  I want to be told the sum of two numbers

  Scenario: Add two numbers
    Given I have entered 50 into the calculator
    And I have entered 70 into the calculator
    When I press add
    Then The result should be 120 on the screen</pre>
Next is the parser, that parses the feature, so no magic here. Unless you think RegEx is magic.
<pre class="brush: ruby;">require 'spec/expectations'

Before do
	@calculator = Calculator.new
end

Given /^I have entered (\d+) into the calculator$/ do |n|
  @calculator.push(n.to_i)
end

When /^I press (\w+)$/ do |op|
  @result = @calculator.op(op)
end

Then /^The result should be (\d+) on the screen$/ do |n|
  @result.should == n.to_f
end</pre>
Then the Implementation, this once just has a couple of methods, but can be extened with more if needed.
<pre class="brush: ruby;">class Calculator
  def push(n)
    @args ||= []
    @args &lt;&lt; n
  end

  def op(type)
	res = 0
	case type
		when "add"
				@args.each do |input|
				  res += input
				end
	end
	res
  end
end</pre>
So, to run it you need to have Cucubmer &amp; RSpec installed, fastest way to install them is to do:
<pre class="brush: plain;">gem install cucumber
gem install rspec</pre>
When everything is installed just do
<pre class="brush: plain;">cucumber addition.feature</pre>
and your result should look something like this:
<pre class="brush: plain;">Feature: Addition
  In order to aviod silly misstakes
  As a math idiot
  I want to be told the sum of two numbers

  Scenario: Add two numbers                     # addition.feature:6
    Given I have entered 50 into the calculator # steps.rb:7
    And I have entered 70 into the calculator   # steps.rb:7
    When I press add                            # steps.rb:11
    Then The result should be 120 on the screen # steps.rb:15

1 scenario
4 passed steps</pre>

But all the lines starting with Given, And, When, Then should be in green if the test passed
