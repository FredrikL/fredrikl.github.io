I ordred a <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/">MacBook Pro </a>(13 inch model) during the weekend, reconfigured it to come with 4gb ram, so with alot of luck i'll have it before the next weekend. So just a heads up that there will be a bit more ruby, mac etc on the blog and some more Android.
