If you have a wcf service hosted in IIS that is using a binding that isn't based on http wiring (like <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.servicemodel.nettcpbinding.aspx">net.tcp</a>) it with your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control">IoC</a> container requires some additional steps. For this example i'm using <a href="http://docs.castleproject.org/Windsor.MainPage.ashx">Castle Windsor</a>, first install the <a href="http://nuget.org/packages/Castle.WcfIntegrationFacility">Castle Windsor WCF integration facility</a> from nuget, that will pull Castle Windsor & their extensions for wcf.

If the binding used for the wcf service isn't based on http then the Applicaton_Start method in global.asax.cs won't be called before the service is invoked. This will cause a problem if our serivce has dependecies that need to be injected. To setup the container used to resolve dependencies we create a class in the App_Code folder under the website that has a method with the following signature: <strong>public static void AppInitialize()</strong> this method will be called before our service is invoked the first time so it is a perfect place to setup our IoC container.

A simple registration would look like this
<pre class="brush:csharp">public class AppInit
{
  private static IWindsorContainer _container;
  public static void AppInitialize()
  {
    _container = new WindsorContainer();
    _container.AddFacility<WcfFacility>();
    _container.Register(Component.For<IService>().ImplementedBy<Service>());
  }
}
</pre>

The last thing to do is in the Serivce.svc markup add the castle factory attribute: <strong>Factory="Castle.Facilities.WcfIntegration.DefaultServiceHostFactory, Castle.Facilities.WcfIntegration"</strong>.
