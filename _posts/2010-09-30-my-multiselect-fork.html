Forked my first repository on <a href="http://github.com">github</a> today, a <a class="zem_slink" title="JQuery" rel="homepage" href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> widget called <a href="http://www.quasipartikel.at/multiselect/">Multiselect</a>. It was only a small change, added a change event to the widget to be able to subscribe to selection changes. Why ? needed it to do nice ajax stuff. Haven't decided yet if it's a change worth sending back, might need to test it some first to see if it's stable enough.

My version can be found <a href="http://github.com/FredrikL/multiselect">here</a>.
