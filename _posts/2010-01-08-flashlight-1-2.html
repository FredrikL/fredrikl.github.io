A couple of days ago I uploaded version 1.2 of flashlight on market. It feels the the final version things added from 1.1 is support for red tint (use of a red background instead of white). The project is hosted on <a href="http://github.com">github</a> and can be found here: <a href="http://github.com/FredrikL/android-flashlight">http://github.com/FredrikL/android-flashlight</a>.

Some market statistics as of today:
<ul>
	<li>3850 downloads</li>
	<li>61% active installs</li>
	<li>Rated 4/5 (32 ratings)</li>
</ul>
I was thinking of having this post as some kind of code review but since there's not that much code in the application itself it didn't seem like much of a point.
